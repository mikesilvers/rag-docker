# RAG Docker — Implementation

**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** 2026-09-10  
**Depends on:** SPECIFICATIONS.md v1.4

---

## 1. Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter the project directory
cd rag-docker

# Start the full stack. No chmod is needed: the ollama service runs
# ["/bin/bash", "/entrypoint.sh"], so the script's executable bit is irrelevant.
docker compose up -d

# Tail logs to watch progress
docker compose logs -f ollama

# Once healthy, open the UI (the proxy publishes 8080 on the host)
open http://localhost:8080
```

On first run Docker pulls ~3.8 GB of base images, builds the api and ui images,
then Ollama downloads `phi3.5` (2.2 GB) and `nomic-embed-text` (274 MB) — roughly
10–20 minutes in total, almost entirely network-bound. Subsequent starts are
immediate because the images are built and the models are cached in the
`ollama_models` Docker volume.

**Docker must be allocated 12 GB of memory and 2 GB of swap** (Settings →
Resources); on a 16 GB Mac that is the practical ceiling, leaving macOS about 4 GB. phi3.5 is ~6 GB resident; below that it is evicted and reloaded between
calls and queries time out. `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health` reports the
allocated figure against the recommendation.

# Install CPU-only torch before anything else pulls it in.
#
# sentence-transformers and unstructured both depend on torch, and the default
# PyPI wheel for linux/aarch64 declares the entire NVIDIA CUDA dependency set:
# ~3.3 GB of nvidia-* packages plus ~800 MB of triton. None of it can execute
# without an NVIDIA GPU, so on Apple Silicon (and any CPU-only host) it is 4.1 GB
# of dead weight. Installing from the PyTorch CPU index first satisfies the torch
# requirement, so the pip run below leaves it alone rather than resolving the
# CUDA build from PyPI.
#
# These two pins are the counterpart to requirements.txt, which is a generated
# lock file that deliberately omits torch and torchvision -- their "+cpu" local
# versions are not published on PyPI. Keep the pins here in step with the
# versions recorded in the requirements.txt header when you re-lock.
#
# If a future dependency requires a newer torch than is pinned here, pip will
# satisfy it from PyPI with the CUDA build and the image balloons back to
# ~7.6 GB. Bump these pins rather than dropping them.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
    torch==2.14.0 \
    torchvision==0.29.0

# requirements.txt is a generated lock (see api/requirements.in to change deps).
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Pre-cache sentence-transformers model at build time
RUN python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"

### api/requirements.txt

```
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LOCK FILE -- do not hand-edit.
#
# Fully pinned dependency set (direct + transitive), generated from a verified build:
#     docker compose build api
#     docker run --rm rag-docker-api pip freeze
#
# Direct dependencies (the human-maintained intent) live in requirements.in.
# To change a dependency: edit requirements.in, rebuild, re-freeze, commit both.
#
# torch and torchvision are deliberately ABSENT. They are installed from the
# PyTorch CPU index in api/Dockerfile because the default PyPI wheel pulls in
# ~4.1 GB of unusable NVIDIA CUDA packages. Their resolved versions are:
#     torch==2.14.0+cpu
#     torchvision==0.29.0+cpu
# Pinning them here would break the build, since the "+cpu" local version
# identifiers are not published on PyPI.

### api/requirements.in

```text
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Direct dependencies -- the human-maintained intent. EDIT THIS FILE.
#
# This file is NOT installed by the Dockerfile. The build installs the fully
# pinned set (direct + transitive) from requirements.txt, generated from it.
#
# To add, remove, or bump a dependency -- run these from the REPO ROOT:
#   1. edit api/requirements.in
#   2. resolve it against the CURRENT image, which already has CPU-only torch:
#        docker run --rm -v "$PWD/api/requirements.in:/r.in:ro" rag-docker-api \
#          pip install --quiet --dry-run --report /dev/stdout -r /r.in \
#          | python -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); \
#              print("\n".join(i["metadata"]["name"]+"=="+i["metadata"]["version"] \
#                               for i in d.get("install",[])))'
#      That prints exactly what is missing from the lock. Add those lines to
#      api/requirements.txt, keeping it LC_ALL=C sorted.
#   3. docker compose build api   # confirm the lock installs cleanly
#   4. docker run --rm rag-docker-api pip freeze \
#        | grep -viE '^(torch|torchvision)==' | LC_ALL=C sort > /tmp/pins.txt
#      diff that against requirements.txt to confirm nothing else moved.
#   5. commit BOTH files together
#
# An earlier version of this note said to edit requirements.in and rebuild, then
# freeze. That does not work: api/Dockerfile installs requirements.txt and never
# reads requirements.in, so the rebuild resolves nothing new and the freeze
# returns the old set unchanged. The `.md` ingest dependency was missing for
# exactly this reason -- `unstructured[pdf,docx,csv]` omitted the `md` extra, and
# no rebuild would ever have revealed it.
#
# Note the drift between the floors below and what actually resolved: these
# ranges are open-ended, so re-locking can pull major versions (for example
# langchain-text-splitters 0.3 -> 1.1.2). Always test after re-locking.
#
# torch and torchvision are not listed here. They arrive transitively via
# sentence-transformers and unstructured, and api/Dockerfile installs them from
# the PyTorch CPU index first to avoid ~4.1 GB of unusable NVIDIA CUDA packages.

**Atomicity, and where it departs from the plan.** The plan said to build into a
temporary collection and rename it on success. Weaviate has no rename:
`client.collections` offers create/delete/exists/get/list_all and nothing else,
confirmed against 4.23.1. So the guarantee in spec §6.5 — a failed import leaves
no partial collection and never destroys the target — is met differently
depending on whether there is anything to protect:

* `abort` and `rename` produce a collection name that does not yet exist, so the
  build goes straight into it and is deleted on failure. Nothing pre-existing is
  at risk, and there is no second pass.
* `replace` builds into a temporary collection first, to prove the package
  inserts cleanly, and only then deletes the existing collection and builds the
  real one. That costs a second insert pass, which is the price of a
  staged replace with a recoverable failure path in a database that cannot rename. If the second pass
  fails, the temporary collection is *kept* and named in the error, so the data
  is recoverable rather than lost.

"""Copying Ollama models into and out of an export package.

Ollama stores a model as a manifest plus content-addressed blobs:

    models/manifests/registry.ollama.ai/library/<name>/<tag>   (JSON)
    models/blobs/sha256-<hex>                                  (config + layers)

The manifest names every blob the model needs, so bundling resolves blobs
*through the manifest* rather than copying the blob store. The store here holds
2.3 GB across 9 blobs for two models; a naive copy would sweep up unrelated
weights, and on a machine with other models pulled it would be far worse.

Copying the files verbatim is deliberate. Offline there is no registry to pull
from, and rebuilding a model through Ollama's HTTP API would mean reconstructing
its template, params and license from the config blob — a reproduction, not the
model that produced the vectors.

"""Re-chunking, re-embedding and re-indexing a collection in place.

Spec §7. Every operation here rebuilds the collection, because chunk identity
or vector width changes and Weaviate cannot alter either in place.

**Safety.** Each rebuild is staged: the new chunks are built into a temporary
collection first, and the live one is replaced only once that succeeds. Weaviate
has no rename (see `importer.py`), so the final step copies vectors out of the
staging collection rather than re-embedding — one embedding pass, not two. A
failure before replacement leaves the original untouched. After replacement
starts, a verified recovery copy and its sidecars survive failure and restart.
Identity-changing operations flag retained evaluations before replacement;
failed reindex cutovers flag them when exact identity cannot be verified.

**Gold standard.** Anything that changes chunk identity marks every session for
the collection `stale`, with a reason and a timestamp. Sessions are never
deleted and never remapped (spec §7.3).

### api/templates/partials/encryption.md

```markdown
## ⚠ Packages are not encrypted

Nothing in a package is protected. `sources/` holds the original documents byte
for byte, and `chunks.jsonl` holds their text. If the corpus contains
confidential or personal material, the package does too. Move and store it
accordingly.
```

### api/templates/partials/fidelity_table.md

```markdown
| Fidelity | Means |
|---|---|
| `with-sources` | The original documents travel with the package. Every tuning operation is available after import, including re-chunking. |
| `chunks-only` | No original documents. The collection can be imported and queried, but it cannot be re-chunked, and re-embedding works from chunk text rather than the source, so it is approximate. |
```

### api/templates/partials/embedding_rule.md

```markdown
Vectors are only meaningful to the model that produced them. A vector from a
different embedding model is not merely different — it is meaningless in this
vector space, and a collection built from mismatched vectors answers every query
confidently and wrongly.

Import therefore **refuses** a package whose embedding model is not the one this
instance runs, rather than warning about it. This instance uses
`@@EMBED_MODEL@@` at @@EMBED_DIMENSIONS@@ dimensions.

Check any machine with `docker compose exec ollama ollama list`.
```

### api/templates/partials/naming.md

````markdown
```
ragpkg-<collection>-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<id8>.tar.gz
```

The collection name in the filename is lowercased and stripped of punctuation,
so it is lossy, and two different collections can produce the same label. `<id8>`
is the first eight hex characters of the manifest's own digest.

**`manifest.json` is authoritative.** Import reads the collection name from there
and never parses the filename. Renaming a package file changes nothing about what
it contains.

Every file listed in the manifest's `files` map carries a SHA-256 digest, and
import verifies all of them before touching the database. `manifest.json`,
`README.md` and `retrieve.py` are not in that map: the first cannot contain its
own digest, and the other two are generated from it afterwards.

python3 retrieve.py --timeout 900 "a question that needs a long answer"
```

It needs Python 3 and nothing else — no `pip install` — because the air-gapped
case is the one this project targets. It exits 0 on success, 2 on bad usage,
3 if the API is unreachable or times out, 4 if the collection is absent and 5 if
the API returns an error.

A package carries `retrieve.py` only when the collection had retrieval settings
saved. A script claiming tuned parameters while carrying stock defaults would be
worse than no script.

# RAG package — @@COLLECTION_NAME@@

This archive is a portable copy of one RAG collection: its chunks and their
vectors, the settings it was tuned with, and — at `with-sources` fidelity — the
original documents it was built from.

- **Collection:** `@@COLLECTION_NAME@@`
- **Chunks:** @@CHUNK_COUNT@@
- **Source documents:** @@SOURCE_DOCUMENT_COUNT@@
- **Fidelity:** `@@FIDELITY@@`
- **Embedding model:** `@@EMBED_MODEL@@` (@@EMBED_DIMENSIONS@@ dimensions)
- **Created:** @@CREATED_AT@@
- **Package id:** `@@ID8@@`

## What fidelity means

@@INCLUDE:fidelity_table@@

This package is **`@@FIDELITY@@`**. @@FIDELITY_NOTE@@

## Prerequisite: the embedding model must match

@@INCLUDE:embedding_rule@@

## Importing

1. Copy this `.tar.gz` into the target instance's `./exports/` directory.
2. Open the web UI and go to **Transfer → Import**, or call the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/import \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"filename": "@@PACKAGE_FILENAME@@", "on_conflict": "abort"}'
```

3. Poll the returned `job_id` at `GET /api/import/job/{job_id}`.

`on_conflict` is required and has no default. It is one of `abort` (fail if the
name is taken), `rename` (import under a free name) or `replace` (overwrite,
but only after this package has been proven to import cleanly).

## The filename is a label, not an input

This package is:

```

# Moving a RAG between machines

A collection can be exported as a single `.tar.gz` and imported somewhere else —
another laptop, a customer's machine, an air-gapped network. The package carries
the chunks and their vectors, the settings the collection was tuned with, a
standalone query script and, when the originals were retained, the source
documents themselves.

Everything below is rendered from the same templates that generate the
`README.md` inside each package, so the two cannot disagree.

## Where packages live

Both directions use `./exports/` in the project directory, which is a bind mount
rather than a Docker volume so you can pick files up and drop them in directly.

- **Exporting** writes the `.tar.gz` there.
- **Importing** reads from there: copy a package in first, then import by filename.

`GET /api/packages` lists what is currently in that directory, including files it
cannot read — those are shown rather than hidden, so nothing disappears silently.

Packages are never deleted automatically, and importing never modifies the file.

## Naming

@@INCLUDE:naming@@

## What a package contains

@@INCLUDE:contents@@

## Fidelity: with-sources or chunks-only

@@INCLUDE:fidelity_table@@

**Why some collections are `chunks-only`.** Retaining original documents was
added after the first version of this platform. A collection ingested before that
has its chunks and vectors but not the files they came from, so it exports as
`chunks-only`. Nothing is wrong with it — it imports and answers questions
normally. It simply cannot be re-split, because the text to re-split is gone.

Re-ingesting the original documents into a new collection is the way to get full
fidelity for an older corpus.

## The embedding model rule

@@INCLUDE:embedding_rule@@

If the target machine has no embedding model at all, export with
`include_models: true`. That bundles `@@EMBED_MODEL@@` and `@@LLM_MODEL@@` as
Ollama's own manifest and blob files, taking the package from kilobytes to
roughly 2.3 GB. On import a model already present is left alone, provided its
files match their checksums; a missing one is installed from the package and
checked before the collection is built. If the embedding model is present but
damaged, the import fails with `MODEL_INTEGRITY_FAILED`: restore or re-pull it,
then import again.

Without bundled models, importing into a machine that lacks the embedding model
fails with `EMBEDDING_MODEL_MISSING` — a different error from a mismatch, because
the remedy is different.

## Handling a name collision

`on_conflict` is required when importing and has no default, because the wrong
choice can delete a collection.

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `abort` | Fail if a collection of that name already exists. |
| `rename` | Import alongside it as `<name>_imported_<id8>`. |
| `replace` | Overwrite it — but only after the incoming package has been proven to import cleanly, so a failed replace leaves the original intact. |

Replacing a collection keeps its gold-standard sessions and marks them orphaned,
and the import result reports how many. They are never deleted silently.

## Tuning after import

| Goal | Requires | How |
|---|---|---|
| Change mode, `top_k` or `alpha` | nothing | Retrieval page, or per request on `POST /query` |
| Change index type or distance metric | nothing | `POST /tune/reindex` — reuses the existing vectors |
| Change chunk size, overlap or strategy | `with-sources` | `POST /tune/rechunk` |
| Change the embedding model | `with-sources` preferred | `POST /tune/reembed` |
| Add documents | matching embedding model | normal ingest |

`GET /api/tune/<collection>` reports which of these a given collection can do.

Every rebuild is staged into a temporary collection and swapped in only once it
succeeds, so a failed tune leaves the collection as it was.

**Gold-standard sessions are flagged, never deleted or remapped.** Re-chunking or
re-embedding changes which chunks exist, so evaluation pairs built against the
old ones no longer describe what is stored; those sessions are marked `stale`
with a reason and a timestamp. Guessing which new chunk replaces an old one would
corrupt a baseline silently, which is worse than an honest flag. Changing only
the index or distance metric does not touch chunk identity, and leaves sessions
alone.

## 5. Verification Suite

Integration tests for the acceptance criteria in Section 10 of
`SPECIFICATIONS.md` and Section 13 of `RAG_EXPORT_SPECIFICATIONS.md`.
They require a running stack; `scripts/verify/README.md` explains why unit
tests would not have caught the defects this project actually produced.

### scripts/verify/model_integrity.py

```python
"""Real bundled-model filesystem acceptance; no model parsing or shared-store writes.

Run on the disposable API with: python - < scripts/verify/model_integrity.py
Existing pulled embedding-model bytes are copied into a temporary package/store,
then all temporary content is removed. The live store is only read.
"""

import shutil
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path
from unittest.mock import patch
from config import settings
from services import model_bundle as models

model = settings.embed_model
assert models.is_installed(model), 'Review embedding model is not byte-consistent'
print('PASS existing review embedding model has matching referenced bytes', flush=True)
files = models.export_model(model, Path())

        shutil.copyfile(source, destination)
    total = sum(source.stat().st_size for _, source in files)

        assert {p: p.stat().st_mtime_ns for p in stamps} == stamps
        print('PASS already-present real blobs reused unchanged', flush=True)
        name, _ = models.split_ref(model)
        damaged = pkg / 'models' / name / 'blobs' / digests[-1].replace(':', '-')

### scripts/verify/README.md

````markdown
# Verification suite

Integration tests that run the acceptance criteria in `SPECIFICATIONS.md` §10
and `RAG_EXPORT_SPECIFICATIONS.md` §13 against a live stack.

```bash
docker compose up -d          # they need the stack running

bash scripts/verify/all.sh                    # everything, ~20 min
RAG_SKIP_SLOW=1 bash scripts/verify/all.sh    # skip LLM work, ~3 min
bash scripts/verify/all.sh 02 04              # only the named suites
```

Exits non-zero if any check fails.

## Focused import validation regressions

Run `python3 scripts/tests/test_session_implementation.py` from the repository root to check that the embedded session/import/package service examples retain the current validated implementation.

`05_transfer.sh` registers both controlled regressions and the source-contract check, so `all.sh` runs them. Its E23 live checks use digest-valid synthetic packages to verify malformed metadata is refused before replacement and valid metadata is restored on rename. The retained-source boundary group checks import refusal before backend/model work, valid digest identity, and export refusal of unsafe paths and links.

`scripts/tests/test_session_import.py` exercises the real package reader and
evaluation persistence with disposable fixtures. Model and database mutation
seams are mocked; this complements the live transfer suite and does not prove
Weaviate/Ollama acceptance. Run it using the API image's pinned dependencies:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps \
  -v "$PWD/scripts/tests:/tests:ro" -e RAG_TEST_API_DIR=/app \
  api python /tests/test_session_import.py
```

Alternatively, with `uv` on the host:

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.11 \
  --with pydantic-settings==2.15.0 --with pydantic==2.13.5 \
  --with httpx==0.28.1 --with weaviate-client==4.23.1 \
  python scripts/tests/test_session_import.py
```

## Why integration tests

Every defect this project has actually produced was invisible to a unit test of
the same code:

- `.md` files could never be ingested — the `markdown` package was missing from
  the image, so `unstructured.partition.md` failed at import time. The function
  was correct.
- `PATCH /goldstandard/.../pair/...` returned 200 and silently rewrote approved
  content. The handler did exactly what it was written to do.
- Explicit vectors survive Weaviate's vectorizer — the entire import design
  rests on that, and only the database can confirm it.
- A recreated collection inherited a deleted one's chunking settings, because
  deletion removed two of the three things it should have.

These tests talk to the running API, the real Weaviate and the real model, and
drive the UI in a real browser.

## Batch faults and recovery across restart

Run the controlled regressions with the API dependencies installed:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p 'test_batch*.py'
```

For a **disposable stack**, the following fault acceptance uses real Weaviate,
synthetic `VfyBatchRecovery*` collections and the real embedding model. It injects
final-create failures into the test process, retains import/tuning recovery,
restarts the API, then verifies exact UUIDs, properties, vectors and sources.
It also checks real completed-batch rejection/partial acceptance, ingestion UUID
rollback after a post-write read fault, resumption of metadata cleanup after backend
deletion, owned scratch cleanup and retention of an unowned marker-like collection. It must not run against a user's data stack.

```bash
docker compose exec -T api python - prepare < scripts/verify/batch_recovery.py
docker compose restart api
# Wait for /api/health to report healthy before the next phase.
docker compose exec -T api python - check < scripts/verify/batch_recovery.py
docker compose exec -T api python - cleanup < scripts/verify/batch_recovery.py
```

If interrupted, keep the recorded fixtures and run `check` after restarting; run
`cleanup` only after inspecting the result. Recovery journal and sidecar snapshots
live under `UPLOAD_DIR/collection_operations`, outside extraction workspaces.

## Layout

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `all.sh` | entry point; runs the suites and aggregates |
| `lib.sh` | shared helpers: checks, job polling, cleanup |
| `07_settings.sh` | registered live settings validation suite; invokes the standalone helper |
| `settings_validation.py` | standalone: `RAG_API=http://localhost:8080/api python3 scripts/verify/settings_validation.py`; invalid settings, valid defaults and saved round trips on a unique disposable collection; no LLM work |
| `lock.sh` | one verify run at a time: a second `all.sh` or suite exits 3 while another is running, because runs share collection names, scratch files and fixtures. Tested by `scripts/tests/test_verify_lock.sh` |
| `fixtures.py` | the test corpus — six file types plus edge cases, stdlib only |
| `01_infrastructure.sh` | §10.5 — ports, health, config lifecycle, startup sweeps |
| `02_ingest.sh` | §10.1 — six types, ZIP, five strategies, merge rule, partial failure |
| `03_query.sh` | §10.2 — four retrieval modes, citations, latencies, answer style |
| `08_overlap.sh` | called by suite02 (and thus all.sh); real parser/ingest/Weaviate text-storage check on an owned fixture with vectorization disabled; optional `RAG_OVERLAP_REAL_EMBEDDING=1` model acceptance |
| `overlap_chunks.py` | helper for suite08; asserts nonempty text/windows, exact coverage/overlap, tail bounds and pre-storage output limits |
| `04_goldstandard.sh` | §10.3 — generation, the 409 and 422 guards, export schema |
| `05_transfer.sh` | export/import/tuning — E5–E20, E23 and E26–E28; destructive replace fidelity, live metadata and model checks, controlled regressions and source drift |
| `../tests/test_session_import.py` | controlled import/persistence/generation regressions, registered by transfer |
| `../tests/test_source_index_boundary.py` | controlled source-index identity, early import refusal and export read-boundary regressions, registered by transfer |
| `../tests/test_session_implementation.py` | exact embedded source checks, registered by transfer |
| `06_ui.sh` + `browser/` | §10.4 — roles, gating, explainer, delete guard, help page |
| `14_reindex.sh` | exact-record reindex: 24 record/cutover/vectorizer/concurrency cases, fourteen writer/import/recovery cases, four async lifecycle/parent-cleanup cases, two polling-deadline cases and 44 real Weaviate/handler/restart checks with a refused embedding endpoint; run by `05_transfer.sh` |
| `reindex_cases.py` / `reindex.py` | owned controlled cases / actual backend and ASGI job handlers; only scoped synthetic fixtures, canonical local session IDs and exact successful-creation ownership. Verifier collection names deliberately lie outside the parent prefix-sweep namespace. Polling is bounded to 300s, cleanup settlement to 30s; a still-active job reports its ID/status and preserves a durable exact-name fixture receipt/directory before standalone exit; inspection must confirm terminal writer state before exact-name cleanup |
| `compose_target.py` | refuses a remote or mismatched API/Compose target before the new acceptance suite runs |
| `model_integrity.py` | bundled-model byte checks with the pulled embedding model, using a temporary package/store |
| `validate_package.py` | one export package against `RAG_EXPORT_SPECIFICATIONS.md` §4 |
| `09_sampling.sh` | called by suite04 (and thus all.sh), including slow-skip runs; owned synthetic UUID selection without model calls |
| `chunk_sampling.py` | standalone inside disposable API: `python - < scripts/verify/chunk_sampling.py`; real SDK seeded selection on owned synthetic UUIDs with supplied vectors, no model calls |

`10_validity.sh` is called by suite05 (and thus all.sh). It runs
`session_validity.py` inside the disposable API, using an owned real collection,
synthetic retained pairs and in-process HTTP without startup sweeps or model calls.
It checks warning metadata, actual deletion marking and explicit historical export.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `RAG_EXPECTED_PROXY_PORT` | `8080` | expected resolved/live proxy host port; use `18080` with a deliberate loopback test override |
| `RAG_API` | `http://localhost:8080/api` | where the API is |
| `RAG_SKIP_SLOW` | `0` | `1` skips everything that needs an LLM call |
| `RAG_ALLOW_RESTART` | `0` | `1` allows suites to restart the stack (persistence checks) |
| `RAG_GS_SAMPLE` | `3` | gold-standard pairs to generate |
| `RAG_FORMAT_TRIALS` | `3` | paired trials for the answer-length comparison |
| `RAG_NETWORK` | detected | compose network for the browser container |

## Writing a check

`12_persistence.sh` is called by `04_goldstandard.sh` before its slow-model skip, so `all.sh` includes durable session acceptance. It uses a unique real collection, supplied vectors, controlled model pairs, concurrent HTTP requests and a fresh API process reading the saved files. Only its owned fixtures are removed. The same registered script executes `session_persistence_cases.py` in the API image: owned filesystem/concurrency cases additionally hard-kill an owned writer at the replace boundary, pause archive inspection during a concurrent commit, retain generation failure codes and test marker-failure continuation. Native browser criteria verify pending, failed and out-of-order diagnostic refreshes using isolated HTTP responses. The in-container script rejects remote or mismatched `RAG_API` targets before health/backend execution.

The in-container retrieval check first verifies that `RAG_API` selects this Compose proxy on its published loopback port; remote or mismatched deployments are refused before execution. Its disposable collections use legacy staging markers, or persisted scratch ownership when the recovery service is present, so startup can finish cleanup after an interrupted verifier. Normal exit deletes only its own fixtures. Browser criteria cover Top-K1/50 save payloads, metadata-read failures and out-of-order refresh completion with isolated HTTP responses.

`11_retrieval.sh` is called by03/all.sh and runs `retrieval_controls.py` on owned real physical configurations/vector queries, controlling only model responses and avoiding startup sweeps.

`check <name> <exit-status> [detail]` — pass `$?` straight in:

```bash
[ "$status" = completed ] && [ "$chunks" -gt 0 ]
check "the job stored chunks" $? "status=$status chunks=$chunks"
```

Two rules the hard way:

- **Never pipe an API response through `echo`.** Shells interpret backslash
  escapes, and an LLM-generated answer containing `\n` becomes invalid JSON.
  Pipe `curl` straight into `python3`, or capture to a file.
- **Make a failing assertion fail loudly.** A check that compares two empty
  strings passes and proves nothing. Several early versions of these tests
  passed vacuously — asserting on a selector that matched nothing, or comparing
  a count to itself.

## Bundled-model integrity

On a disposable stack with its embedding model already pulled, run:

```bash
docker compose exec -T api python - < scripts/verify/model_integrity.py
```

This verifies the real model's referenced bytes, copies them into a temporary
package/store, checks valid install and unchanged reuse, and refuses ordinary
mismatched bytes without changing the published manifest or healthy blobs.
The actual shared model store is only read; temporary content is removed. It
needs disk space for two copies of the embedding model and performs several
streamed hash passes. It does not invoke a model parser or claim trusted model
provenance. Controlled regression tests additionally cover digest grammar,
containment, interrupted publication and concurrent blob publication:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p 'test_model_bundle.py'
```

## Cleaning up

Suites create collections prefixed `Vfy` (`RAG_TEST_PREFIX`) and remove them at
the end. If a run is interrupted:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/collections | python3 -c \
  "import json,sys;[print(c['name']) for c in json.load(sys.stdin)['collections']]" \
  | grep '^Vfy' | xargs -I{} curl -s -X DELETE "localhost:8080/api/collections/{}?confirm=true"
```

`13_identity.sh` is registered by `05_transfer.sh`/`all.sh`. It executes fourteen owned cache/disk/collision/redirected-slot/historical-ID/concurrent-insertion cases in the API image, then a real export/edit/rename-import-twice roundtrip with supplied vectors and synthetic evaluation pairs. It verifies returned lookup mappings, independent four-field RAGAS downloads, fresh-process retention, re-export filenames/provenance and original-package byte equality. Two controlled cases verify job-poll and cleanup deadlines. Backend/file/archive operations are delegated to worker threads. Successful collection creation records exact cleanup names; a similarly named protected fixture must survive that cleanup. Jobs have a 300-second poll deadline and 30-second cleanup deadline. If a job remains active, the standalone verifier exits 2 without executor joining or deleting its retained fixture directory, reporting the job/status/path. Only its exact owned fixtures are removed; in-container checks reject remote/mismatched targets before health/backend execution. Native browser criteria verify the existing Transfer notes expose source/local session IDs.

The infrastructure suite requires Docker Engine 28.0.0+ and checks both resolved Compose and live Docker bindings for a single loopback proxy publication. When deploying an alternate host port for testing, set `RAG_EXPECTED_PROXY_PORT` to that port as well as `RAG_API`. Its inspection files are kept in a private temporary directory removed on exit. The local profile assumes standard bridge/NAT routing.

Run `python3 scripts/tests/test_loopback_verification.py` from the repository root for the verifier's engine-version and adverse binding regressions. These exercise the actual assertion blocks and resolved default Compose; the live infrastructure suite still requires a running stack.


`reindex_verifier_cases.py` checks actual async failure cleanup and the parent shell cleanup predicate without a backend/model call. The registered suite transports its helper, the actual `lib.sh`, and these controlled tests into an owned temporary API directory. `test_collection_writes.py` checks waiting writers, case aliases, reentrancy, failures, independent collections and actual import/backend entry points, a paused complete replace-import cutover and sidecar restoration, positive ownership before import staging, and ordinary staging failure/recovery cleanup. The live suite refuses altered property vectorization and removes exact durably owned import scratch after an independent process exits without finally.

The concurrency HTTP check uses supplied-vector ingestion fixtures while keeping the upload handler, parser, chunker, worker, source retention and actual backend writes real. Its reindex source check pauses under the writer guard; the upload remains queued until final copy verification. Recovery is separately forced to fail at final creation and verified through an independent API lifespan. These cases do not claim generative model quality.

Tuning normalizes the backend first-character alias for active jobs and ownership, while preserving the caller-spelled identity for source/config/session sidecars. All tuning operations register positive staging ownership before creation and retain recovery before cutover. Explicit deletion of an exact positively owned recovery collection retires its matching journal and metadata snapshots; unrelated or invalid journals remain. Startup alone does not discard retained snapshots merely because a backend collection is missing. Interrupted explicit cleanup remains durable and is resumed at startup.

### package.sh

Source-only archive (~150 KB). The target machine rebuilds the images and
re-downloads the models, so it needs internet.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Build a clean, distributable zip of this project.
#
#   bash package.sh [output.zip]
#
# Invoke with `bash package.sh` rather than `./package.sh` so the script does
# not depend on its own executable bit surviving a file transfer.
#
# What the archive contains: source, Dockerfiles, compose file, both lock files
# (ui/package-lock.json and api/requirements.txt) and the docs. That is
# everything needed to rebuild the stack from scratch.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT contain: Docker images, the Weaviate index, and
# the Ollama model weights. Those are rebuilt or re-downloaded on the target
# machine -- roughly 8-10 GB of network traffic on first run.
#
# THE TARGET MACHINE MUST HAVE INTERNET ACCESS for this package to work.
# For an air-gapped install, use package-offline.sh instead: it ships the
# pre-built images and model weights, and needs no network on the target.
# See "Moving to another Mac" in README.md.
