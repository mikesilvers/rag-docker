"""Re-chunking, re-embedding and re-indexing a collection in place.

Spec §7. Every operation here rebuilds the collection, because chunk identity
or vector width changes and Weaviate cannot alter either in place.

**Safety.** Each rebuild is staged: the new chunks are built into a temporary
collection first, and the live one is replaced only once that succeeds. Weaviate
has no rename (see `importer.py`), so the final step copies vectors out of the
staging collection rather than re-embedding — one embedding pass, not two. A
failure before replacement leaves the original untouched. After replacement
starts, a verified recovery copy and its sidecars survive failure and restart.
Identity-changing operations flag retained evaluations before replacement;
failed reindex cutovers flag them when exact identity cannot be verified.

**Gold standard.** Anything that changes chunk identity marks every session for
the collection `stale`, with a reason and a timestamp. Sessions are never
deleted and never remapped (spec §7.3).
