"""The import job: validate a package, then build a collection from it.

Reads the package through `packager.py` so the format has exactly one
implementation. Validation order is spec §6.2 and stops at the first failure.

**Atomicity, and where it departs from the plan.** The plan said to build into a
temporary collection and rename it on success. Weaviate has no rename:
`client.collections` offers create/delete/exists/get/list_all and nothing else,
confirmed against 4.23.1. So the guarantee in spec §6.5 — a failed import leaves
no partial collection and never destroys the target — is met differently
depending on whether there is anything to protect:

* `abort` and `rename` produce a collection name that does not yet exist, so the
  build goes straight into it and is deleted on failure. Nothing pre-existing is
  at risk, and there is no second pass.
* `replace` builds into a temporary collection first, to prove the package
  inserts cleanly, and only then deletes the existing collection and builds the
  real one. That costs a second insert pass, which is the price of a
  staged replace with a recoverable failure path in a database that cannot rename. If the second pass
  fails, the temporary collection is *kept* and named in the error, so the data
  is recoverable rather than lost.
